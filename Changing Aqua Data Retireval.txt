The AQUA application uses the Unity Dependency Injection (DI) Framework to support switching between different data access technologies (ADO.NET Data Services & ADO.NET Entity Framework). By default AQUA uses the REST based ADO.NET Data Services framework to access patient data via web services. In additional AQUA can be configured to use a local SQL Server database accessed via the ADO.NET Entity framework. To switch between the different data access approaches you need to change the repository classes loaded via Unity. AQUA uses the repository data access pattern to encapsulate the logic for querying its data sources. The source code for AQUA include two sets of repository classes: One for ADO.NET Data Services and one for ADO.NET Entity Framework. To switch between the different repository classes you need to update the Unity config section in app.config to point to the data access approach you want to use. This is done by switching the namespace of the repository class (See Example below). Note: you will need to do this for each repository and repository provide defined in app.config.

ADO.NET Data Services - <typeAlias alias="ChatResponseRepository" type="Infragistics.Guidance.Aqua.DataClient.Data.ServicesRepositories.ChatResponsesRepository, Infragistics.Guidance.Aqua.DataClient" />

ADO.NET Entity Framework - <typeAlias alias="ChatResponseRepository" type="Infragistics.Guidance.Aqua.DataClient.Data.EntityRepositories.ChatResponsesRepositoryEF, Infragistics.Guidance.Aqua.DataClient" />
